This repository uses the [Feature Branch Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/workflows#!workflow-feature-branch) method.

This repository stores the master branch, and possibly developer's feature branches for peer review / pull request purposes. Developers work locally on feature branches from a clone of the upstream master branch. See the link for full details of this workflow method.
